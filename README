to install, execute:
- make runv
- # the library should build and all tests should pass 
- sudo make install # this will install the library and header files off the /usr prefix

to build your unit test binary, add the follow to your CFLAGS and/or CXXFLAGS: `pkg-config ExtremeCUnit --cflags`
and add to your LDFLAGS: `pkg-config ExtremeCUnit --libs`



you can write your unit tests in a separate file or include them in same files as the rest of your source code. You can encapsolate code you don't want include in the release binary via 
#ifdef UNIT_TEST 
TEST() {
...
}
...
#endif

if your binary already has a main function, you will need to encapsolate it in 
#ifndef UNIT_TEST
int main(.. ){
}
#endif


To use the -g or -G command line args, your effective user must be root or /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
needs to be to 0. You can use the following command to set.

echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

this setting will go away after the system restarts. To make prem. edit /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf and change the line:

kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1

To read

kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0
