to install, execute:
- make runv
- # the library should build and all tests should pass 
- sudo make install # this will install the library and header files off the /usr prefix

to build your unit test binary, add the follow to your CFLAGS and/or CXXFLAGS: `pkg-config ExtremeCUnit --cflags`
and add to your LDFLAGS: `pkg-config ExtremeCUnit --libs`



you can write your unit tests in a separate file or include them in same files as the rest of your source code. You can encapsolate code you don't want include in the release binary via 
#ifdef UNIT_TEST 
TEST() {
...
}
...
#endif

if your binary already has a main function, you will need to encapsolate it in 
#ifndef UNIT_TEST
int main(.. ){
}
#endif
